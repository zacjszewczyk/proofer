<h2>Artificial Intelligence at the Tactical Cyber Edge</h2>

<p>Back in 2019, Rudy <span class='long'>Guyonneau</span> and Arnaud Le Dez captured a common fear in <span class='long'>Artificial</span> <span class='long'>Intelligence</span> in <span class='long'>Digital</span> Warfare: &#8220;The question of AI now tends to <span class='long'>manifest</span> under the guise of a <span class='long'>mythicized</span> <span class='long'>omniscience</span> and <span class='long'><span class='alternate'>therefore</span></span>, of a <span class='long'>mythicized</span> <span class='long'>omnipotence</span>. This can lead to <span class='long'>paralysis</span> of people fearful of having to fight against some super-<span class='long'>enemy</span> endowed with such an <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> that it would leave us bereft of <span class='long'>solutions</span>.&#8221; In 2022, when ChatGPT exploded onto the scene, it looked like that fear had come true. The <span class='long'>reality</span>, though,<span class='avoid'>is</span>less <span class='long'>sensational</span>. As <a href="blog/microsoft.html"><span class='long'>Microsoft</span></a> and <a href="blog/openai.html"><span class='long'>OpenAI</span></a> <span class='long'>recently</span> explained, <span class='dup'>today</span> we see <span class='trite tooltip'>state<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: say, tell us, write down</span></span>-<span class='long'>affiliated</span> threat actors using <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> in <span class='long'>interesting</span> but not <span class='long'>invincible</span> ways. There<span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>valuable</span> roles for <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> to play in cyber <span class='long'>operations</span>. Much of that value <span class='dup'>today</span>, <span class='long'><span class='alternate'>however</span></span>, lies in the defense. Through <span class='long'>accelerating</span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>, <span class='long'>improving</span> warning <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span>, more <span class='long'>efficient</span> <span class='long'>education</span>, and more <span class='long'>realistic</span> training, <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> could have a drastic impact on <span class='long'>defensive</span> cyber <span class='long'>operations</span> <span class='dup'>today</span>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheStateofPlayof<span class='long'>Artificial</span><span class='long'>Intelligence</span>inCyber<span class='long'>Operations</span>">The State of Play of <span class='long'>Artificial</span> <span class='long'>Intelligence</span> in Cyber <span class='long'>Operations</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheStateofPlayof<span class='long'>Artificial</span><span class='long'>Intelligence</span>inCyber<span class='long'>Operations</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p><span class='long'>Microsoft</span> and <span class='long'>OpenAI</span> found five threat actors from four countries using <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span>. At the start of their campaigns, the groups used large language <span class='dup'>models</span> for target research, as <span class='long'>translators</span>, to build tools, and to write content for phishing campaigns. Later, <span class='long'>Microsoft</span> saw the <span class='dup'>models</span> <span class='long'>recommending</span> post-<span class='long'>compromise</span> actions. Although <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08144">some research</a> has proposed that modern <span class='dup'>models</span> could take on more, that <a href="https://struct.github.io/llm_auto_hax.html">seems</a> <a href="https://struct.github.io/auto_agents_1_day.html"><span class='long'>premature</span></a>. Rather than the letdown of an over-hyped promise, though, we ought to view these case studies as early examples of proper uses for <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> in <span class='long'>offensive</span> cyber <span class='long'>operations</span>. In stark contrast to ideas that <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> would unleash a wave of robot hackers on the world, these actors used the tools to <span class='long'>automate</span> mundane tasks. <span class='long'>Defensive</span> cyber forces, on the other hand, could use this <span class='long'>technology</span> in a number of <span class='long'>impactful</span> ways, starting with <span class='long'>accelerating</span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="<span class='long'>Accelerating</span>thePaceof<span class='long'>Analysis</span>"><span class='long'>Accelerating</span> the Pace of <span class='long'>Analysis</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#<span class='long'>Accelerating</span>thePaceof<span class='long'>Analysis</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Endpoints and network sensors create hundreds of billions of events per day across the <span class='long'>Department</span> of Defense’s <span class='long'>Information</span> Network. Indeed, &#8220;<span class='dup'>data</span> <span class='long'>overload</span><span class='avoid'>is</span><span class='dup'>not</span> a danger <span class='dup'>but</span> rather a given.&#8221; Cyber <span class='long'>analysts</span> must <span class='dup'>not</span> only sift through oceans of <span class='dup'>data</span>, though, <span class='dup'>but</span> they must also grapple with &#8220;techniques and <span class='long'>strategies</span> [that] evolve at a frantic pace, the former through the <span class='long'>exigence</span> imposed by early <span class='long'>experiences</span> in the field and the rate of <span class='long'>technological</span> <span class='long'>development</span>, the latter as our <span class='long'>understanding</span> of the stakes grows.&#8221; It<span class='avoid'>is</span><span class='dup'>not</span> just the volume of <span class='dup'>data</span> in the fifth domain that confounds <span class='long'>understanding</span>, <span class='dup'>but</span> it&#8217;s <span class='long'>complexity</span> as well. This ocean of <span class='long'>uncertainty</span><span class='avoid'>is</span>a prime target for two of the most common forms of <span class='long'>artificial</span> <span class='long'>intelligence</span>, machine learning and large language models.</p>

<p>While machine learning will never turn <span class='dup'>data</span> into knowledge on its own, it <span class='dup'>can</span> <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>accelerate<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: speed up</span></span></span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>. These <span class='long'><span class='long'>algorithm</span>s</span> might not grasp <em>why</em> an endpoint behaves <span class='long'>abnormally</span>, but they excel at flagging <span class='long'>unusual</span> <span class='long'>activity</span> for human <span class='long'>investigation</span>. Applied at scale, such a pairing could shift the burden of looking through millions of logs onto a <span class='long'>computer</span> while freeing up humans for more <span class='long'>nebulous</span> <span class='long'>investigative</span> work. The <span class='long'>complexity</span> of training, tuning, <span class='long'>evaluating</span>, <span class='long'>employing</span>, and <span class='long'>interpreting</span> the output of these <span class='long'><span class='long'>algorithm</span>s</span>, though, means that few use them well, if at all. Large language models could lower that bar. ChatGPT or the open source Llama 3, for instance, <span class='dup'>can</span> abstract away those tedious, error-prone steps. Instead of spending my time writing code for a random forest <span class='long'>regression</span>, for <span class='long'>example</span>, I <span class='dup'>can</span> tell ChatGPT to &#8220;Build a random forest <span class='long'>regression</span> based on this sample <span class='dup'>data</span> set.&#8221; Instead of spending my time digging through pages of complex <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>documentation<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: papers, documents</span></span></span> to tune the <span class='long'>algorithm</span>&#8217;s <span class='long'>hyperparameters</span>, I <span class='dup'>can</span> tell Llama 3 to <span class='long'>optimize</span> them. Tasks that might have taken the rare <span class='dup'>data</span> scientist hours to days to achieve <span class='dup'>can</span> now take an <span class='long'>enterprising</span> <span class='long'>analyst</span> just a few <span class='long'>minutes</span>.</p>

<p>Large language models <span class='dup'>could</span> also <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>accelerate<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: speed up</span></span></span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span> as the backbone for <span class='long'>analyst</span> support tools. Cyber <span class='long'>analyst</span>s start many <span class='long'><span class='long'>investigation</span>s</span> based on opaque, machine-<span class='long'>generated</span> alarms. For <span class='long'>example</span>, an alert that &#8220;Trojan!Win32&#8221; malware <span class='dup'>could</span> have <span class='long'>infected</span> an endpoint might entail hours of work just to gather basic <span class='long'>information</span>. A large language model <span class='dup'>could</span> instead present an <span class='long'>analyst</span> with a brief <span class='trite tooltip'>report<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: tell</span></span> that explained the alert, assessed suspect files, <span class='long'>collated</span> <span class='long'>information</span> about the host that raised the alarm, and suggest next steps for the <span class='long'>investigation</span>. The <span class='long'>approximate</span> <span class='long'>distillation</span> of <span class='long'>humanity</span>&#8217;s knowledge into a single model presents <span class='long'>defensive</span> cyber <span class='long'>analyst</span>s with an <span class='long'>incredible</span> <span class='long'>opportunity</span> to <span class='long'>externalization</span> mundane tasks like these. Such a support tool, <span class='long'>entirely</span> <span class='long'><span class='alternate'>feasible</span></span> with today&#8217;s <span class='long'>technology</span>, would <span class='long'>drastically</span> <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>accelerate<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: speed up</span></span></span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImprovedWarning<span class='long'>Intelligence</span>">Improved Warning <span class='long'>Intelligence</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImprovedWarning<span class='long'>Intelligence</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Machine learning could also help <span class='long'>analysts</span> derive meaning from <span class='long'>internet</span>-wide scanning <span class='dup'>data</span> for improved warning <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span>. <span class='long'>Traditional</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> <span class='long'>processes</span> have struggled to keep pace with the <span class='dup'>cyber</span> domain. Many reports on servers used to launch attacks, command and control malware implants, or receive <span class='long'>exfiltrated</span> <span class='dup'>data</span> arrive far too late to do any good. They <span class='trite tooltip'>provide<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: give</span></span> <span class='long'>interesting</span> but seldom <span class='long'>actionable</span> <span class='long'>information</span>. By <span class='long'>extracting</span> those servers&#8217; traits from <span class='long'>internet</span>-wide scanning <span class='dup'>data</span>, though, and then training models to <span class='long'>recognize</span> them, <span class='dup'>cyber</span> <span class='long'>analysts</span> could deploy models against live <span class='dup'>data</span> feeds to <span class='long'>proactively</span> <span class='long'>identify</span> new <span class='long'>malicious</span> <span class='long'>infrastructure</span> in near-real time. Rather than acting on <span class='long'>similar</span> insights in days or weeks as reports make their way out of an <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> cycle, this <span class='long'>strategy</span> presents a <span class='long'>promising</span> avenue to <span class='long'>operationalize</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> in the <span class='dup'>cyber</span> domain at machine speed.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="More<span class='long'>Efficient</span><span class='long'>Education</span>">More <span class='long'>Efficient</span> <span class='long'>Education</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#More<span class='long'>Efficient</span><span class='long'>Education</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>While <span class='long'>operational</span> use cases for <span class='long'>artificial</span> <span class='long'>intelligence</span> abound, it could also <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>enable<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: allow</span></span></span> better <span class='long'>preparation</span> for those <span class='long'>defensive</span> cyber missions, too. Creating, running, and <span class='long'>managing</span> <span class='dup'>training</span>, for <span class='long'>example</span>,<span class='avoid'>is</span><span class='long'><span class='avoid'>extremely</span></span> time <span class='long'>consuming</span> and <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>exceptionally<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: only when, in this case</span></span></span> <span class='long'>difficult</span> to do well. I dealt with this challenge just last year in the fledgling 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force. Stood up without any way to train its <span class='long'>sizeable</span> cyber <span class='long'>formation</span>, we found ourselves once again re-creating the wheel by building our own <span class='dup'>training</span> program. We planned to spend over a year on this project. After some <span class='long'>experimentation</span>, though, we found a way to use large language models to create the entire <span class='long'>curriculum</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;to include lessons plans, <span class='dup'>training</span> <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>material<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: relevant</span></span></span>, <span class='long'>practical</span> <span class='long'>exercises</span>, and <span class='long'>assessments</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in just a few hours.</p>

<p><span class='long'>Another</span> project used large language models to build <span class='dup'>threat</span> hunting and <span class='long'><span class='dup'>investigation</span></span> <span class='dup'>playbooks</span> based on MITRE&#8217;s ATT&#38;CK matrix, an <span class='long'>industry</span> standard <span class='long'>taxonomy</span> that describes <span class='long'>malicious</span> <span class='long'>activities</span> in the cyber domain. <span class='dup'>The</span> <span class='dup'>threat</span> hunting <span class='long'>notebooks</span> first describe actions a <span class='dup'>threat</span> actor might take when <span class='long'>attacking</span> a network, then detail ways to find <span class='long'>evidence</span> of that <span class='long'>activity</span>. <span class='dup'>The</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>investigation</span></span> <span class='dup'>playbooks</span> contain <span class='long'>complementary</span> guidance for <span class='long'>investigating</span> that <span class='long'>evidence</span>. <span class='long'>Together</span>, <span class='dup'>these</span> <span class='long'>documents</span> promote <span class='long'>analytic</span> rigor by helping even the most junior <span class='long'>analysts</span> to approach <span class='dup'>these</span> complex problems in a <span class='long'>similar</span> way as their more <span class='long'>experienced</span> <span class='long'>counterparts</span>. Over the years I have seen many groups pursue that lofty goal. Given that the MITRE ATT&#38;CK matrix consists of 625 techniques, though, all have burnt out long before <span class='long'>achieving</span> it. <span class='dup'>The</span> process of <span class='long'>researching</span>, <span class='long'>understanding</span>, and then <span class='long'>developing</span> <span class='long'>detection</span> <span class='long'>mechanisms</span> and <span class='long'><span class='dup'>investigation</span></span> <span class='long'>processes</span> for such a vast array of <span class='long'>malicious</span> <span class='long'>activities</span> would have taken me months, if I had ever <span class='long'>completed</span> it at all. A large language model <span class='long'>generated</span> <span class='dup'>these</span> <span class='dup'>playbooks</span>, though, based on a template and a handful of examples, in a few hours.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="More<span class='long'>Realistic</span>Training">More <span class='long'>Realistic</span> Training<span>&nbsp;<a href="#More<span class='long'>Realistic</span>Training">#</a></span></h3>

<p><span class='long'>Artificial</span> <span class='long'>intelligence</span> could also improve the <span class='long'>quality</span> of hands-on <span class='dup'>training</span> as well. <span class='long'>Realistic</span> <span class='long'>scenarios</span> that even come close to the immense <span class='long'>complexity</span> of the real world<span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>exceedingly</span> <span class='long'>difficult</span> to build, run, and maintain. So much so, in fact, that they do not exist. Michael Schwille, Scott Fisher and Eli Albright <span class='long'>recently</span> discussed this in We Wanted to <span class='long'>Implement</span> Data-Driven <span class='long'>Operations</span> During an Army <span class='long'>Exercise</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;Here&#8217;s What We Learned. As Rudy and Arnaud pointed out in 2019, though, &#8220;If the <span class='long'>corresponding</span> data exists and can<span class='avoid'>be</span>acquired, a <span class='long'>cyberteammate</span> has the <span class='long'>capacity</span> to <span class='long'>simulate</span> any type of <span class='long'>environment</span>, whether friendly, neutral, or <span class='long'>adversarial</span>.&#8221; An <span class='long'>artificial</span> <span class='long'>intelligence</span> agent could manage this entire function, from <span class='long'>generating</span> the <span class='long'>underlying</span> code and then <span class='long'>deploying</span> it in an <span class='long'>Infrastructure</span> as Code <span class='long'>capacity</span> to creating and <span class='long'>managing</span> complex <span class='long'>scenarios</span> with <span class='long'>synthetic</span> <span class='long'>adversary</span> <span class='long'>activity</span> that responds to the actions of the <span class='dup'>training</span> audience in real time. No longer must <span class='long'>analysts</span> suffer through small, contrived <span class='long'>exercises</span> based on canned scripts put on by under resourced <span class='dup'>training</span> cells.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="<span class='long'>Conclusion</span>"><span class='long'>Conclusion</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#<span class='long'>Conclusion</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>There<span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>valuable</span> roles for <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> to play in <span class='dup'>cyber</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>operations</span></span>.

In the lead up to those <span class='long'><span class='dup'>operations</span></span>, <span class='long'><span class='dup'>artificial</span></span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> could help lessen the crushing burden of training <span class='long'>development</span> and <span class='long'>execution</span>.
