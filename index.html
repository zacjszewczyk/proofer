<h2>Artificial Intelligence at the Tactical Cyber Edge</h2>

<p>In 2019, Rudy <span class='long'>Guyonneau</span> and Arnaud Le Dez captured a common fear in <span class='long'>Artificial</span> <span class='long'>Intelligence</span> in <span class='long'>Digital</span> Warfare: &#8220;The question of <span class='long'>artificial</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> now tends to <span class='long'>manifest</span> under the guise of a <span class='long'>mythicized</span> <span class='long'>omniscience</span> and <span class='long'><span class='alternate'>therefore</span></span>, of a <span class='long'>mythicized</span> <span class='long'>omnipotence</span>. This can lead to <span class='long'>paralysis</span> of people fearful of having to fight against some super-<span class='long'>enemy</span> endowed with such an <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> that it would leave us bereft of <span class='long'>solutions</span>.&#8221; With the release of ChatGPT in 2022, it looked like that fear had come true. But the <span class='long'>reality</span> wasn&#8217;t so <span class='long'>exciting</span>. As <a href="blog/microsoft.html"><span class='long'>Microsoft</span></a> and <a href="blog/openai.html"><span class='long'>Open<span class='dup'>AI</span></span></a> <span class='long'>recently</span> explained, today we see threat actors using <span class='dup'>AI</span> in <span class='long'>interesting</span> but not <span class='long'>invincible</span> ways. There<span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>valuable</span> roles for <span class='dup'>AI</span> to play in cyber <span class='long'>operations</span>. Much of that value today, <span class='long'><span class='alternate'>however</span></span>, lies in the defense. Through <span class='long'>accelerating</span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>, improved warning <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span>, more <span class='long'>efficient</span> <span class='long'>education</span>, and more <span class='long'>realistic</span> training, <span class='dup'>AI</span> could have a drastic impact on <span class='long'>defensive</span> cyber <span class='long'>operations</span>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheStateofPlayof<span class='long'>Artificial</span><span class='long'>Intelligence</span>inCyber<span class='long'>Operations</span>">The State of Play of <span class='long'>Artificial</span> <span class='long'>Intelligence</span> in Cyber <span class='long'>Operations</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheStateofPlayof<span class='long'>Artificial</span><span class='long'>Intelligence</span>inCyber<span class='long'>Operations</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p><span class='long'>Microsoft</span> and <span class='long'>OpenAI</span> found five hacker groups from four countries using AI. At first, the groups used large language models for research, <span class='long'>translation</span>, building <span class='dup'>tools</span>, and writing phishing emails. Later, <span class='long'>Microsoft</span> saw the <span class='dup'>tools</span> <span class='long'>suggesting</span> actions after a system had<span class='avoid'>been</span>hacked. Although <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08144">some</a> argue that modern models could take on more, that <a href="https://struct.github.io/llm_auto_hax.html">seems</a> <a href="https://struct.github.io/auto_agents_1_day.html"><span class='long'>premature</span></a>. Rather than the letdown of an over-hyped promise, though, we ought to view <span class='dup'>these</span> as early examples of proper uses for <span class='dup'>these</span> <span class='dup'>tools</span> in <span class='long'>offensive</span> cyber <span class='long'>operations</span>. In stark contrast to ideas that AI would unleash a wave of robot hackers on the world, <span class='dup'>these</span> actors used it for mundane tasks. <span class='long'>Defensive</span> cyber forces, on the other hand, could use this <span class='long'>technology</span> in a number of ways, starting with <span class='long'>accelerating</span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="<span class='long'>Accelerating</span>thePaceof<span class='long'>Analysis</span>"><span class='long'>Accelerating</span> the Pace of <span class='long'>Analysis</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#<span class='long'>Accelerating</span>thePaceof<span class='long'>Analysis</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Endpoints and network sensors create billions of events per day across the <span class='long'>Department</span> of Defense’s <span class='long'>Information</span> Network. Indeed, &#8220;data <span class='long'>overload</span><span class='avoid'>is</span>not a danger but rather a given.&#8221; As Rudy and Arnaud pointed out, though, volume<span class='avoid'>is</span>only half the battle. Cyber <span class='long'>analysts</span> must also grapple with &#8220;techniques and <span class='long'>strategies</span> [that] evolve at a frantic pace, the former through the <span class='long'>exigence</span> imposed by early <span class='long'>experiences</span> in the field and the rate of <span class='long'>technological</span> <span class='long'>development</span>, the latter as our <span class='long'>understanding</span> of the stakes grows.&#8221; It<span class='avoid'>is</span>not just the volume of data in the fifth domain that confounds <span class='long'>understanding</span>, but it&#8217;s <span class='long'>complexity</span> as well. This ocean of <span class='long'>uncertainty</span><span class='avoid'>is</span>a prime target for two of the most common forms of AI, machine learning and large language models.</p>

<p>Machine learning won&#8217;t turn <span class='dup'>data</span> into knowledge by itself, but it <span class='dup'>can</span> speed up <span class='long'>analysis</span>. These models might not know <em>why</em> an endpoint acts the way it does, but they <span class='dup'>can</span> spot weird <span class='long'>activity</span>. At scale, they shift the burden of sifting through millions of logs onto a <span class='long'>computer</span>. As a result, people spend less time searching for the <span class='long'>digital</span> needle in the cyber haystack and more time on complex <span class='long'>investigations</span>. The challenge of training, tuning, <span class='long'>assessing</span>, using, and parsing the output of these <span class='long'>algorithms</span>, though, means that few use them well, if at all. Large language models <span class='dup'>can</span> help. ChatGPT or the open source Llama 3, for instance, <span class='dup'>can</span> handle these tricky steps. Instead of coding a support vector machine, I <span class='dup'>can</span> ask ChatGPT to &#8220;Build a support vector machine with this sample <span class='dup'>data</span>.&#8221; Instead of sifting through pages of <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>documentation<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: papers, documents</span></span></span> to tune <span class='long'>hyperparameters</span>, I <span class='dup'>can</span> ask Llama 3 to tune them. Tasks that once took <span class='dup'>data</span> scientists hours <span class='dup'>can</span> now take an eager <span class='long'>analyst</span> just <span class='long'>minutes</span>.</p>

<p>Large language models <span class='dup'>could</span> also <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>accelerate<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: speed up</span></span></span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span> as the backbone for <span class='long'>analyst</span> support tools. Cyber <span class='long'>analyst</span>s start many <span class='long'><span class='long'>investigation</span>s</span> based on opaque alarms. For <span class='long'>example</span>, an alert that &#8220;Trojan!Win32&#8221; malware <span class='dup'>could</span> have <span class='long'>infected</span> an endpoint might entail hours of work just to gather basic <span class='long'>information</span>. A large language model <span class='dup'>could</span> instead create a brief <span class='trite tooltip'>report<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: tell</span></span> that explained the alert, assessed suspect files, <span class='long'>collected</span> facts about the host that raised the alarm, and offered next steps for the <span class='long'>investigation</span>. <span class='long'>Externalizing</span> mundane tasks like these would <span class='long'>drastically</span> <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>accelerate<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: speed up</span></span></span> the pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>.</p>

<p>As a stepping stone between manual and semi-<span class='long'>autonomous</span> <span class='long'><span class='long'>investigation</span>s</span>, one of my projects used large language models to build <span class='long'>analyst</span> <span class='dup'>playbooks</span>. These <span class='dup'>playbooks</span> guide junior <span class='long'>analyst</span>s to approach complex <span class='long'><span class='long'>investigation</span>s</span> in a <span class='long'>similar</span> way as their more <span class='long'>experienced</span> <span class='long'>counterparts</span>. They promote <span class='long'>analytic</span> rigor. The process of <span class='long'>researching</span>, <span class='long'>understanding</span>, and then creating <span class='long'>detections</span> and <span class='long'>investigation</span> <span class='long'>strategies</span> for such a vast array of <span class='long'>malicious</span> <span class='long'>activities</span>, though, takes months. Over the years I have seen many pursue this lofty goal yet <span class='long'>inevitably</span> fail. Using MITRE&#8217;s ATT&#38;CK matrix, which describes 625 <span class='long'>different</span> <span class='long'>malicious</span> actions in the cyber domain, large language models, and a bit of Python, though, I built a <span class='long'>library</span> of over 600 <span class='dup'>playbooks</span> in a few hours.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImprovedWarning<span class='long'>Intelligence</span>">Improved Warning <span class='long'>Intelligence</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImprovedWarning<span class='long'>Intelligence</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Machine learning could also help derive meaning from <span class='long'>internet</span>-wide scanning data for improved warning <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span>. The <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> cycle has struggled to keep pace with the cyber domain. Many reports on <span class='dup'>servers</span> used to launch attacks or control malware implants arrive far too late to do any good. They <span class='trite tooltip'>provide<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: give</span></span> <span class='long'>interesting</span> but seldom <span class='long'>actionable</span> <span class='long'>information</span>. By finding the traits of those <span class='dup'>servers</span> from <span class='long'>internet</span>-wide scans and training machine learning models to spot them, cyber <span class='long'>analysts</span> can use these tools on live data feeds to quickly find new <span class='long'>malicious</span> <span class='dup'>servers</span>. Rather than acting on <span class='long'>similar</span> insights in days or weeks as reports make their way out of an <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> cycle, this approach would <span class='long'>operationalize</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>intelligence</span></span> at machine speed.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="More<span class='long'>Efficient</span><span class='long'>Education</span>">More <span class='long'>Efficient</span> <span class='long'>Education</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#More<span class='long'>Efficient</span><span class='long'>Education</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>While <span class='long'>operational</span> use cases for AI abound, it could also better prepare <span class='long'>analysts</span> for <span class='long'>defensive</span> cyber missions, too. Training, for instance, takes a lot of time and<span class='avoid'>is</span>hard to do well. I dealt with this just last year in the new 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force. Stood up without any way to train its large cyber <span class='long'>formation</span>, we found ourselves again re-creating the wheel by building our own training program. We planned to spend over a year on this project. After some <span class='long'>experimentation</span>, though, we found a way to use large language models to create the entire <span class='long'>curriculum</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;to include lessons plans, training <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>material<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: relevant</span></span></span>, and even some hands-on <span class='long'>exercises</span> and <span class='long'>assessments</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in just a few hours.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="More<span class='long'>Realistic</span>Training">More <span class='long'>Realistic</span> Training<span>&nbsp;<a href="#More<span class='long'>Realistic</span>Training">#</a></span></h3>

<p>AI could also improve hands-on training. <span class='long'>Realistic</span> <span class='long'>scenarios</span><span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>exceedingly</span> <span class='long'>difficult</span> to build, run, and maintain. So much so, in fact, that they do not exist. Michael Schwille, Scott Fisher and Eli Albright <span class='long'>recently</span> discussed this in We Wanted to <span class='long'>Implement</span> Data-Driven <span class='long'>Operations</span> During an Army <span class='long'>Exercise</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;Here&#8217;s What We Learned. As Rudy and Arnaud pointed out in 2019, though, &#8220;If the <span class='long'>corresponding</span> data exists and can<span class='avoid'>be</span>acquired, a <span class='long'>cyberteammate</span> has the <span class='long'>capacity</span> to <span class='long'>simulate</span> any type of <span class='long'>environment</span>, whether friendly, neutral, or <span class='long'>adversarial</span>.&#8221; An AI agent can handle <span class='long'>everything</span> from writing the code and <span class='long'>deploying</span> it in an <span class='long'>Infrastructure</span> as Code <span class='long'>capacity</span> to running <span class='long'>realistic</span> <span class='long'>scenarios</span> with <span class='long'>synthetic</span> actors that respond to trainees&#8217; actions in real time. No longer must <span class='long'>analysts</span> suffer through small, contrived events based on canned scripts put on by under resourced training cells.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="<span class='long'>Conclusion</span>"><span class='long'>Conclusion</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="#<span class='long'>Conclusion</span>">#</a></span></h3>

<p>There<span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>valuable</span> roles for <span class='dup'>AI</span> to play in <span class='dup'>cyber</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>operations</span></span>. In <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2024/04/how-will-ai-change-<span class='dup'>cyber</span>-<span class='long'><span class='dup'>operations</span></span>/">How Will <span class='dup'>AI</span> Change Cyber <span class='long'>Operations</span>?</a>, Jenny Jun captured this well when she said &#8220;Sharper Swords, Tougher Shields.&#8221; Much of that value today, <span class='long'><span class='alternate'>however</span></span>, lies in <span class='long'>defensive</span> <span class='dup'>cyber</span> <span class='long'><span class='dup'>operations</span></span>. As a <span class='dup'>cyber</span> <span class='long'>analyst</span>, I have access to hundreds of billions of new records perf day&#160;&#8212;&#160;a prime target for machine learning. An <span class='long'>analyst</span> support tool, built on top of a large language model, could further <span class='long'><span class='trite tooltip'>accelerate<span class='tooltiptext'>Consider replacing with: speed up</span></span></span> my pace of <span class='long'>analysis</span>. In the lead up to those <span class='long'><span class='dup'>operations</span></span>, <span class='dup'>AI</span> could help lessen the crushing burden of building and running training. Unlike many lofty ideas that over-promise and under-<span class='long'>deliver</span>, these goals<span class='avoid'>are</span><span class='long'>realistic</span> and <span class='long'>achievable</span> with the resources line units have today. We say we want <span class='long'>innovation</span>&#160;&#8212;&#160;here<span class='avoid'>is</span>the <span class='long'>opportunity</span>; we must seize it.
